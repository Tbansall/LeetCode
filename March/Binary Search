Requirement : Array should be sorted in ascending order
In this Algorithm basically what we are doing is :

we're finding a middle element then comparing it to target if it equals we're returning it
If target is greater we move to the greater side by assigning start = mid+1
if target is smaller we move to the lower side by assigning last = mid-1

    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start=0,end = nums.length-1;
        while(start<=end)
        {
            int mid = (start+end)/2;
            if(target==nums[mid])
                return mid;
            else if(target>nums[mid])
                start = mid+1;
            else
                end = mid-1;
            
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

Let's dry run this code for nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9 :

=> for this start = 0 ,end = 5
while(0<=5)
{
	mid = (0+5)/2; //which is 2
	if(nums[2] == 9) // nums[2] = 3 , target = 9 but this condition is false it'll go to next statement
	else(9>3)
	start = 3
	else
	end = 1; // It'll not go to this statement
}

=>  now start becomes 3 and end is 5
while(4<=5)
{
	mid = (3+5)/2 // which is 4
	if( nums[4] == 9) // nums[4] = 9 this condition is true
	return 4;	
}
